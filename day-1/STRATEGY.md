## 🚀 Strategic Questions: How Might We...

### 1. Model Costs with Depth

#### Objective
Create a comprehensive cost model that accounts for all platform expenses and growth projections.

#### Key Considerations
- **Variable Costs**
  - API usage (OpenAI, Claude)
  - Database storage growth
  - Bandwidth and CDN
  - Per-user infrastructure costs
  
- **Fixed Costs**
  - Base infrastructure (servers, databases)
  - Monitoring and security tools
  - Development tools and licenses
  - Team salaries

#### Action Items
- [ ] Analyze existing billing patterns from Replit
- [ ] Calculate per-user unit economics
- [ ] Project costs at 10x, 100x, 1000x scale
- [ ] Reach out to support about enterprise pricing
- [ ] Compare cloud provider options (AWS vs GCP vs Azure)

#### Success Metrics
- Clear understanding of burn rate
- Identified cost optimization opportunities
- Enterprise agreement negotiations initiated

---

### 2. Implement Workarounds

#### Objective
Find practical solutions to immediate pain points while maintaining velocity.

#### Current Workarounds Needed
- **GitHub Projects** for project management
- **Manual deployments** while building CI/CD
- **Single environment** constraints
- **Authentication** without SSO

#### Trade-offs to Consider
| Workaround | Benefit | Risk | Timeline |
|------------|---------|------|----------|
| GitHub Projects | Immediate PM tool | Limited features | Now |
| Manual QA | No setup required | Human error | 5 days |
| Shared staging | Quick to implement | Conflicts | 2 days |
| Basic auth | Already exists | Not enterprise-ready | Defer |

#### SSO Considerations
- **Immediate Need**: Basic multi-user support
- **Medium Term**: Google/Microsoft SSO
- **Long Term**: SAML for enterprise

#### 5-Day Sprint Constraints
- Focus on critical path items only
- Defer nice-to-have features
- Document technical debt created
- Plan follow-up sprints

### 4. Re-architect the Architect

#### Objective
Transform the current monolithic deployment into a scalable, multi-tenant architecture.

#### Architectural Changes

##### Multi-Environment Strategy
```
Current State:          Target State:
┌──────────┐           ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│   PROD   │    →      │ DEV │ STG │ PROD│
└──────────┘           └─────┴─────┴─────┘
   Replit              AWS Multi-Environment
```

##### Multi-Tenancy Implementation
- **User Isolation**: Database row-level security
- **Resource Limits**: Per-tenant quotas
- **Custom Domains**: Tenant-specific URLs
- **Data Separation**: Logical or physical isolation

##### Payment & Subscriptions Architecture
```
User → Subscription → Plan → Features
         ↓              ↓        ↓
      Billing      Limits    Access
         ↓              ↓        ↓
      Stripe      Quotas    Gates
```

#### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Environment separation
2. **Phase 2**: Basic multi-tenancy
3. **Phase 3**: Payment integration
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features
