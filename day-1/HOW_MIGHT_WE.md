# How Might We...

## 1. Model costs with depth
- Variable versus fixed
- Look at existing billing patterns
- Reach out to support about enterprise

## 2. Workarounds
- GitHub and Projects are the main ones, while moving fast
- SSO and trade offs
- In 5 days

## 3. Turn this shit into a blog post worth reading
- Clearly articulate the problems with Replit and our goals

## 4. Re-architect the architect
- Replit apps per environment
- Implement multi-tenancy, multi-environments, and payment and subscriptions (linked to the 3 epics above)
