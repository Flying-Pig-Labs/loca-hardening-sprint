## üêõ Debugging Common Issues

### Button Doesn't Appear

1. **Check Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab):
   ```
   Look for: "PromptDoctor: Initializing..."
   Look for: "PromptDoctor: Button injected successfully"
   ```

2. **Verify Selectors**: The extension looks for textareas with these patterns:
   - placeholder containing: "prompt", "describe", "tell", "ask"
   - aria-label containing: "prompt", "agent"
   - Parent containers with "agent" or "prompt" in class names

3. **Manual Injection Test** (in DevTools Console):
   ```javascript
   // Check if content script is loaded
   if (typeof PromptDoctorInjector !== 'undefined') {
     console.log('Content script is loaded');
   } else {
     console.log('Content script NOT loaded');
   }
   ```

### Button Appears Multiple Times
- Check for navigation events causing re-injection
- Verify `isInjected` flag is working
- Look for duplicate script injections

### Extension Not Working
1. Reload the extension:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click refresh icon on PromptDoctor card
2. Reload the Replit page
3. Check permissions are granted for replit.com

## üìä Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
1. Open Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc)
2. Find "Extension: PromptDoctor"
3. Should use < 50MB memory
4. No memory leaks on navigation

### Injection Speed
- Measure time from page load to button appearance
- Should be < 2 seconds on fast connections
- Maximum wait time: 30 seconds

## üîç Advanced Testing

### Different Replit Environments
Test on various Replit pages:
- [ ] New Repl creation page
- [ ] Existing Repl with Agent
- [ ] Repl without Agent (button shouldn't appear)
- [ ] Mobile view (responsive design)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Very long prompts (1000+ characters)
